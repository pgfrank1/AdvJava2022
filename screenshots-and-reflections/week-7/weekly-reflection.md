# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I really liked the ability to use key value pairs. I can already see how helpful these classes will be
when interacting with databases.

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

Learning the differences between a Tree map and a Hash map.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

Using the Hash Map in the Tree Map constructor took a little bit figure out.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All work is entirely my own.
