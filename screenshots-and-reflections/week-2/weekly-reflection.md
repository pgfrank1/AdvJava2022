# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

Getting GitHub setup and working was very easy. My current C# class really helped with that.

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

Learning how to use the new build and test system compared to the previous Java course. Also remembering
to instantiate objects.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I attempted to do the lab without watching the walkthrough and I was running into multiple problems.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

I did not use any outside resources on any parts of this submission - the work is entirely my own.
