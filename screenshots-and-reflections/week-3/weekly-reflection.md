# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I really liked to be able to learn more about catching exceptions. I tried to teach myself a bit about it in my JavaScript course
but I didn't fully understand what each exception meant.

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

I always heard about needing to close files to save on memory but I wasn't able to learn about it until now.
I also really liked to learn how to open and create files. 

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I had a bit of trouble on Lab 5 tests. I tried to read the errors that appeared but it took me a while to 
figure out that I simply didn't have the correct println output. The formatting threw me off a bit.  

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

I did not use any outside resources on any parts of this submission - the work is entirely my own.
