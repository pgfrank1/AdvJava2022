# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

My biggest "AHA!!" moment was when I finally understood how I can format the output for the 
TokenLocationSearchAnalyzer class.

#### What were your biggest challenges completing this project?

The biggest one was definitely the TokenLocationSearchAnalyzer class output
formatting. I also had some issues with the Properties jsp. I finally found that the
issue was not having getters for 2 of the instance variables.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Used https://www.studytonight.com/java-examples/how-to-multiply-string-in-java 
to be able to repeat the stars for the histogram

I also used https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_break.asp to make sure I was using
the correct term when continuing or breaking from a loop
