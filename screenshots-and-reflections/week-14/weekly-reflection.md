# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I was easily able to understand sessions as we have just learned about it in PHP

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

Session variables can be very useful, but we also need to interact with constant
variables with the database.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I didn't run into any issues this week

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All work is entirely my own.
