# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

It showed me how useful key value pairs are. I can already see the use when we
start interacting with databases.

#### What were your biggest challenges completing this project?

Going back through our old code and trying to remember how each class links up.
It definitely made me see how important documentation is as I would have taken
much longer without it.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All work is entirely my own.
