# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

Some of my AHA moments was figuring out where I can eliminate duplicate code and
trying to figure out where is best to use ServletContext or Session.

#### What were your biggest challenges completing this project?

My biggest challenge was attempting to get the actual results from the employee
ArrayList in the Search object. I was able to see that the results were appearing because of the
boolean within the search object but for a while, I couldn't get the ArrayList itself. It
was such a relief to see that first_name value appear on the screen.
