# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I think I'll be able to adapt quickly to the JSP syntax. It appears to be fairly similar to
PHP.

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

I can shorten the href links to simply be their file name without any needed
folder structure

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I was wondering why I couldn't access the newly made JSP page, but I realized
I didn't add the .jsp extension to the href attribute

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All work is entirely my own
