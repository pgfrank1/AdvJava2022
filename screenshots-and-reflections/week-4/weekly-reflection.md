# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 
Going through the Trail program and debugging went much quicker than I expected.

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

I remembered how to make proper comments and how the JDOC needs them

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

Trying to remember the order for the PrintWriter, BufferedWriter, and FileWriter
was a bit of a challenge as I couldn't recall the order from memory. Also, all
of the different exceptions are a bit challenging to try and remember.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

I used this Stack Overflow article created by Erwin Ivanov to figure out the 
@throws exception and when to properly use it.
