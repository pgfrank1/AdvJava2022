# Weekly Reflection

# Lab 2:

The first link isn't correct because the port number could change causing the
link to break. The second link isn't correct because it doesn't need to link
directly to the jsp page. You can just call the folder the index.jsp file is
in and it will automatically open that page without telling the user the
name of the file.

#### What went well this week? 

I was able to grasp the concept servlets faster than I anticipated. There are some
specifics that I have to double check myself on but that's about it.

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

The biggest thing I learned was how to change the content response type for the servlets.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I didn't understand how to overrwrite the methods at first. I rewatched the video for servlets
and realized that those methods are a part of the HttpServlet class.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All work is entirely my own.
