# Weekly Reflection

# Lab 2:

The first link isn't correct because the port number could change causing the
link to break. The second link isn't correct because it doesn't need to link
directly to the jsp page. You can just call the folder the index.jsp file is
in and it will automatically open that page without telling the user the
name of the file.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Share your resources here. Example: "When completing Lab 2, I used this [stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28177370/how-to-format-localdate-to-string), to format the date.   

I also got stuck with a corrupt commit error message: 
			
			error: inflate: data stream error (incorrect header check)
			error: corrupt loose object '5cdeb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a'
			fatal: loose object 5cdeb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a (stored in .git/objects/5c/deb9c3a1fe164cb4d2779d1e0d9d9f4ef18c6a) 
			
Curtis, the IT Guide, helped me resolve it by using [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12571557/fixing-a-corrupt-loose-object-as-a-commit-in-git).

If you didn't use any additional resources or receive any outside help, then indicate that as such. Example: "I did not use any outside resources on any parts of this submission - the work is entirely my own."

Replace this text and the examples above with your own references.
