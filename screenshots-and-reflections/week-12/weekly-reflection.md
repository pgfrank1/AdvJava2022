# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

Everything went well and I'm very excited to start getting into databases with Java

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

The syntax and classes needed are different than normal

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I couldn't get variables to work directly in the query. I think all I need
to do is wrap the variables in single quotes

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

All work is entirely my own
