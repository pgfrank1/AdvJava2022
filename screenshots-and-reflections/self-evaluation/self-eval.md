| Criteria | Not started or progressing yet | Making progress | Meets expectations | Exemplary
|---|----|-----|----|----|
| Explanation of scale | Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. This might mean we haven't covered the topic yet, work is incomplete, or work contains too many issues to justify correcting each one. | Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but some significant gaps remain. Needs more work. | Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work, and clear documentation. Some revision or expansion might be needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.| Work meets or exeeds the expectations. A high level of proficiency with the concepts is evident. Work could be used as a classroom example.|

|Course coding standards and industry best practices|  |  |  | I think I have meet expectations with standards. There
 are still a few instances where I miss something. I need to check the code more thoroughly to make sure standards are
 correct. |
|Documentation|  |  |  |  | I believe I am doing very will with the jdoc comments on our labs and projects. To get
 even better, I should try writing even more descriptive comments or even consolidate some.
|Programs meet requirements| | | | I haven't ran into an issue yet where my program isn't working. I'll continue to 
 check all of my code to ensure the program will run.
|Unix Environment|  |  |  |  | I am perfectly okay with the Unix environment. I took a few Linux server classes
 so I am very familiar with the terminal and layout of Ubuntu.
|Git and GitHub|  |  |  | I sometimes miss creating a tag and creating an issue to let you know that my work is done. I need to check each Sunday evening to ensure all of my work is submitted successfully. |
|Java I/O classes|  |  |  | I have a very good understanding of how these classes work. I still get the order of classes and some names incorrect, but I'm able to see the correct syntax using the course website. |
|Java Collections|  |  |  | I believe I have a fairly good understanding of Java Collections. I need to look at what each
 collection is for once in a while. |
|Exception handling and error processing|  |  |  | I'm pretty good at error and exception handling. There hasn't been an issue where I've missed one yet. I just really need to try and remember what the name of important exceptions that occur and catch them |
|Java Properties class|  |  |  | I have a very good understanding Java Properties and key value pairs. I just need to use them in more situations to fully understand their cabibilities. |
|OO Design Principles|  |  |  |  | I believe I have a very good understanding of OOO. I was able to have each method do one task in my code.
|JSPs|  |  |  | I still am a bit new to JSPs. I believe I just need to use them more to understand them better. |
|Servlets|  |  |  | The same goes for servlets. I just need to use them more. |
|JDBC|  |  |  | I also feel fairly new to JDBC. It's mostly a syntax thing compared to other coding languages I use for school. I just need to get used to the class names. |
|Debug and troubleshoot independently|  |  |  |  | I think that troubleshooting code is one of my strong suites. I am able to follow along my code and find where there is an error.
|Learning process reflection and improvement|  |  |  | I think I could do a bit better with taking some notes on code reviews. I remember some of the improvements but not all of them. |
|Best practices for getting programming help| | | | | I haven't asked for help too much, but when I have, I always make sure that I run out of ideas first. I then grab the error and make sure my code isn't fully displayed unless it is needed.
