| Criteria  | Not started or progressing yet | Making progress | Meets expectations | Exemplary |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|


| Explanation of scale | Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. This might mean we haven't covered the topic yet, work is incomplete, or work contains too many issues to justify correcting each one. | Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but some significant gaps remain. Needs more work. | Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work, and clear documentation. Some revision or expansion might be needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.| Work meets or exceeds the expectations. A high level of proficiency with the concepts is evident. Work could be used as a classroom example.|


| Course coding standards and industry best practices |     |     | x   |     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I have met expectations for coding standards. I still make a mistake or two, 
but I can usually find the issue promptly

| Documentation |     |     | x   |     |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I think that my documentation certainly meets expectations. I could add more once 
I have more Java terms memorized.

| Programs meet requirements |     |     | x   |     |
|----------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|

I have had a few problems that became apparent upon our code reviews. However, they 
were usually minor and I have fixed those issues each time 

| Unix Environment |     |     |     | x   |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I am exemplary here as I have never run into any Unix specific issues. If
I ever have, I can easily fix the issue on my own. I have a few different Ubuntu 
servers running here at home for ad blocking and for my file server.


| Git and GitHub |     |     |     | x   |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I haven't run into any issues with using Git and GitHub. With project 4, I feel 
that I went above the expectations with the new commit syntax.

| Java I/O classes |     |     | x   |     |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I have no issues with I/O classes, the syntax, and their uses. I can output and
take input when needed.


| Java Collections |     |     | x   |     |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I think I meet the expectations for collections. I occasionally mix up how to 
call values within Maps and List. But the code is still able to run.


| Exception handling and error processing |     |     | x   |     |
|-----------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
With project 4, I think I improved my understanding of exceptions and errors. I 
can place each Exception within a single method and use it where any exception is 
required. 

| Java Properties class |     |     | x   |     |
|-----------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I had no issues with the properties class, accessing it, and using it within
project 4.


| OO Design Principles |     |     | x   |     |
|----------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe that I meet expectations for design principals. There are some occasions
where I can reduce duplicate code, but I certainly understand OO itself.

| JSPs |     |     | x   |     |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I have a very good understanding of what JSPs are and how they work.
I could definitely learn more about each JSTL tag to improve my JSPs.


| Servlets |     |     | x   |     |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I have a good understanding of Servlets and their uses. I mixed up 
ServletContext and sessions during project 4, but I was able to realize where
the issue was when the search and add employees messages stayed on the page.


| JDBC |     |     | x   |     |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I think I have a very good understanding of JDBC. There are some specifics that 
can slip my mind. But I never have an issue with accessing data with SQL statements


| Debug and troubleshoot independently |     |     |     | x   |
|--------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
This has always been one of my strongest traits even outside of programming
I can always find a way to read through my code and find where the problem.
Even when we are doing a code review, and we notice a problem. I start to
troubleshoot the issue right away.


| Learning process reflection and improvement |     |     | x   |     |
|---------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
This has always been one of my strong traits as well. But I feel that with
this class, I have been slacking on the Self Evals and Reflections. However, I
have updated each missing reflection and eval and shouldn't have any missing.


| Best practices for getting programming help |     |     |     | x   |
|---------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I haven't had an issue with this from the start. I always Google
every issue I encounter and use different ways of explaining the issue, so I
can search the same issue multiple times and get different results.


| Collaboration/Teamwork |     |     | x   |     |
|------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I did very well with our team labs. I coordinated with my partners
with times that work, and I was very patient when we encountered an issue.


1) How have I grown as a developer this semester?<br>I think I have grown a lot since the 
beginning of the semester. I learned so much about how to use Java for a web application,
different ways of debugging, and how to interact with databases.<br> Working on a group
project was one of the biggest things that I think helped me grow as a developer too. 
I haven't had many opportunities in our other classes to be able to work on the same thing
with others. Having to go back in to our projects and add to them was another experience 
new experience for me as well. <br>Having to go back through the code and attempt to remember
how each class and method is connected was a fun new experience. It really made me realize 
how important documentation is for an application.<br> Overall, I can definitely see the
differences from last semester and the end of this semester. I look at a lot of my old
code and question a lot of the choices that I made for multiple different projects.<br><br>
2) What grade do I believe I should receive?<br> I think I got an A for the course. There
are a few things that I can think of that detract from that statement. Such as forgetting
the screenshots and reflections when turning in labs, forgetting to create a new issue
when a lab is ready for review, and having issues come up in our code reviews that should
be working right from the start. Thankfully, you notified me each time that a reflection and/or
screenshot was missing, and we were able to find the issues in my code very quickly. I was
then able to fix those missing documents or issues and return the updated version to you.
I was a little disjointed with my grade on the Final Exam. Funnily enough, I changed
quite a few multiple choice questions that made my answers incorrect when they already were correct.
Overall, with all the effort and corrections that I have made, I believe that could get me an A. 
However, I think that an AB would be more realistic when mentioning my Final Exam grade.
