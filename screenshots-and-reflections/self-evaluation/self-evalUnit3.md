| Criteria  | Not started or progressing yet | Making progress | Meets expectations | Exemplary |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------|


| Explanation of scale | Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. This might mean we haven't covered the topic yet, work is incomplete, or work contains too many issues to justify correcting each one. | Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but some significant gaps remain. Needs more work. | Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work, and clear documentation. Some revision or expansion might be needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.| Work meets or exeeds the expectations. A high level of proficiency with the concepts is evident. Work could be used as a classroom example.|


| Course coding standards and industry best practices |     |     | x   |     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I have beet meeting expectations for coding standards. There can definitely be some
improvement in my max character limit for each class. But the code is all visible without
needed to scroll over.

| Documentation |     |     | x   |     |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
While I believe that my documentation is good, I still think I can improve some
of my documentation by adding more detail.

| Programs meet requirements |     |     | x   |     |
|----------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I had some issues with my Properties page and my program couldn't work
with tiny files and the histogram. But I was able to get both working correctly.

| Unix Environment |     |     |     | x   |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I am Exemplary here as I have never ran into any Unix specific issues.
I have a few different Ubuntu servers running here at home for ad blocking and
for my file server.


| Git and GitHub |     |     | x   |     |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I haven't ran into any issues with using Git and GitHub. I have occasionally forgotten
to notify you of when my labs are done via opening an issue. But that isn't because of
my knowledge of GitHib.

| Java I/O classes |     |     | x   |     |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I have no issues with I/O classes, the syntax, and their uses. I can output and
take input when needed.


| Java Collections |     | x   |     |     |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
While I thought I had everything down with collections, attempting to correct
Project 3 made me realize there is still some progress to go. I only thought
'.get' was able of accessing the values within maps.


| Exception handling and error processing |     | x   |     |     |
|-----------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I still have some issues with knowing which error should be where. I also occasionally
forget to add an output message with the error so that the end user has a basic
idea of the issue. But I understand how they work and where to put them

| Java Properties class |     | x   |     |     |
|-----------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I had some trouble with accessing the Properties for Project 3 correctly, but I
understand how to add key => value pairs to the properties file itself.


| OO Design Principles |     |     | x   |     |
|----------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I have had no issues with trying to stick with OO Design Principles. I do want to
see how these designs can be put into action in an enterprise environment.

| JSPs |     |     | x   |     |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I have a very good understanding of what JSPs are and how they work.
I would like to memorize more of the different tags that can be used.


| Servlets |     |     | x   |     |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I have a good understanding of Servlets and their uses. I want to know
more about them so I can better utilize their potential.


| JDBC | x   |     |     |     |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
We haven't gotten into JDBC in Unit 3


| Debug and troubleshoot independently |     |     |     | x   |
|--------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
This has always been one of my strongest traits even outside of programming
I can always find a way to read through my code and find where the problem.
Even when we are doing a code review and we notice a problem. I start to
troubleshoot the issue right away.


| Learning process reflection and improvement |     | x   |     |     |
|---------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
This has always been one of my strong traits as well. But I feel that with
this class, I have been slacking on the Self Evals and Reflections. I usually
forget that they are there.


| Best practices for getting programming help |     |     |     | x   |
|---------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I haven't had an issue with this from the start. I always Google
every issue I encounter and using different ways of explaining the issue, so I
can search the same issue multiple times and get different results.


| Collaboration/Teamwork |     |     | x   |     |
|------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
I believe I did very well with our team labs. I coordinated with my partners 
with times that work and I was very patient when we encountered an issue.
