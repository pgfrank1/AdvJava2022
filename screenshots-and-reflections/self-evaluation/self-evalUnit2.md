| Criteria | Not started or progressing yet | Making progress | Meets expectations | Exemplary
|---|----|-----|----|----|
| Explanation of scale | Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. This might mean we haven't covered the topic yet, work is incomplete, or work contains too many issues to justify correcting each one. | Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but some significant gaps remain. Needs more work. | Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work, and clear documentation. Some revision or expansion might be needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.| Work meets or exeeds the expectations. A high level of proficiency with the concepts is evident. Work could be used as a classroom example.|

|Course coding standards and industry best practices|  |  |  | I think I have meet expectations with standards. There
 are still a few instances where I miss something. I need to check the code more thoroughly to make sure standards are
 correct. |
|Documentation|  |  |  | I have no issues with missing documentation, however, I think I could still give 
more details | 
|Programs meet requirements|  |  | I generally meet all requirements minus a few minor details. The one thing
that came up for this project was using enhanced for loops on the new analyzers instance variable | 
|Unix Environment|  |  |  | I continue to have no issues with the Unix environment. I would like to 
learn/relearn some terminal commands | 
|Git and GitHub|  |  |  | Git and GitHub commands are memorized now. |
|Java I/O classes|  |  | I have a very good understanding of how these classes work. I still get the order of classes and some names incorrect, but I'm able to see the correct syntax using the course website. |  |
|Java Collections|  | I believe I have a fairly good understanding of Java Collections. I need to look at what each collection is for once in a while.  |  | |
|Exception handling and error processing|  |  | I'm pretty good at error and exception handling. There hasn't been an issue where I've missed one yet. I just really need to try and remember what the name of important exceptions that occur and catch them |  |
|Java Properties class|  |  |  | I have a very good understanding Java Properties and key value pairs. I just need to use them in more situations to fully understand their cabibilities. |
|OO Design Principles|  |  |  | I believe I have a very good understanding of OOO. I was able to have each method do one task in my code. | 
|JSPs|  | I still am a bit new to JSPs. I believe I just need to use them more to understand them better. |  |  |
|Servlets|  |  | I definitely feel more comfortable with servlets now. I still need to use them more to understand their full potential |  |
|JDBC|  |  | I still feel fairly new to JDBC. It's mostly a syntax thing compared to other coding languages I use for school. I just need to get used to the class names.  | |
|Debug and troubleshoot independently|  |  |  |  | I think that troubleshooting code is one of my strong suites. I am able to follow the erros that output to the terminal.
|Learning process reflection and improvement|  |  |  | I think I do a great job at learning from the project reviews and then improving the code from their |
|Best practices for getting programming help| | | | | I haven't asked for help too much, but when I have, I always make sure that I run out of ideas first. I then grab the error and make sure my code isn't fully displayed unless it is needed.
