# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

I was able to catch on to the includes quite easily. I've used them in C# and PHP a few times already

#### What were your key learning points related to this work?

I learned how to keep repetitive HTML in their own jsp files and I learned how useful servlet context can be.
be for variables that work across different webpages.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

Getting an object of ServletContext took longer than expected. 

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

Besides the two articles shared on the Lab 3-6 page, all work is entirely my own.
