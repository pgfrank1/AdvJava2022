    Key Learning Points:
        While working on this project, there were many things that I got to learn. The biggest thing for me was learning
        how to open, read and close files. It started to make me understand how we can process input and possibly even
        interact with other external resources and databases.
    Challenges:
        The biggest challenge for me was trying to format each line of input from the text file and find each distinct token.
        This was the first thing I wanted to complete as it certainly is the most complicated part of this. I'm not sure if there was a better way to place each word onto its own line, but I required 2 splits to be able to get that to happen. Counting the total tokens was much easier as I already had the code to go through each token, I just needed to count them all.
    Help Recieved:
        All of the resources I looked at was at the Java class website. All work was entirely my own.
