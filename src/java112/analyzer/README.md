# The Analyzer Project

This directory will contain the code for the analyer project 2. 

<ul>
    Reflection statement:
    <li>Key Learning Points: The biggest thing for me was learning about the new Maps and Sets and what situation is the best for each. Also making sure to fully read through old code that you're updating.</li>
    <li>Challenges:The biggest challenge for me was trying to go back into my old code and try to modify it without completely removing methods. I had to reset the project once because I changed too much and even the Project 1 analyzer wasn't working anymore. While I knew that Git is extremely important, I haven't had to recover past work before so I could start fresh and try again.</li>
    <li>Help Recieved: All of the resources I looked at was at the Java class website. All work was entirely my own.</li>
</ul>
